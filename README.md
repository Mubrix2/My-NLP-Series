# My-NLP-Series
My Natural Language Processing Projects

A collection of hands-on Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, experiments, and learning notebooks.
This repository showcases my journey through text preprocessing, classical machine learning, deep learning, and modern NLP techniques used in real-world applications.

🚀 What’s Inside
🔹 1. Text Preprocessing

Tokenization (word & sentence)

Removing noise (punctuation, special characters)

Stemming & Lemmatization

Stopword filtering

Normalization (lowercasing, regex cleaning)
