    "    University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) is a federal government-owned public research university in Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria.[2][3] The university's main campus sits on an expansive area of land, about 5,000 hectares in the ancient city of Ilorin; making it the largest university in Nigeria and one of the largest in Africa by landmass. The university comprises 16 faculties and over 100 academic departments offering 103 programmes. It was established by a decree of the Federal Military Government of Nigeria in August,1975. The University of Ilorin has the highest enrollment of foreign students in Nigeria.[4][5] The establishment aimed to implement one of the educational directives of the Third National Development Plan, which was aimed at providing more opportunities for Nigerians aspiring to acquire university education and to generate high-level manpower, which is vital for the rapidly expanding economy. Compared[6] to other higher institutions of learning in the country, the institution has one of the largest land areas, covering approximately 15,000 hectares of land.[7][8] It is reported by Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) to be the most sought-after Nigerian university in 2021.[9] And again in 2023, and also in 2024, it was announced by the JAMB[10][11] Head, Professor Ishaq Oloyede to be the sought-after University, for the 2023 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations (UTME), making it for the 10th consecutive year.\n",
